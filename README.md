This program is not a cryptography tool in any sense. Do NOT use it in production or anything that require security.
The proof of concept was to use a pseudo-random cellular automata and make a file hasher with it. I choose the elementary Rule30 since it has some known property of pseudo-randomizing things around, i biased it with some tricks that you can read into code.
This program can be used in cryptography challenges to learn and practice cryptography.
